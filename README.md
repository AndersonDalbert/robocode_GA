ROBOCODE TANK USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS

The goal of this project is to apply G.A. concepts by creating a tank on Robocode platform, a programming-like game where you can design robots to battle with others. Project developed for the Artificial Intelligence course of Computer Science degree in Federal University of Campina Grande. We used a template for G.A. in robocode, which can be founded here: https://github.com/samternent/robocode-jgap-template
