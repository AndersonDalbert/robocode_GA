# ROBOCODE TANK USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS

The goal of this project is to apply G.A. concepts by creating a tank on Robocode platform, a programming-like game where you can design robots to battle with others. Project developed for the Artificial Intelligence course of Computer Science degree in Federal University of Campina Grande. We used a template that can be found [here](https://github.com/samternent/robocode-jgap-template).

**SETTING UP**

First, you must download and install JGAP and Robocode libraries that can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgap/files/jgap/JGAP%203.6.3/) and [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/).

Then, after clone this project, add the JGAP .jar file and also all the .jar files inside /lib folder from Robocode to the project's *BUILDPATH*.

**EXECUTING**

To start the generations, just run *RobocodeGA* class. You can set up the oponents by changing the files from the tanks in it's corresponding method. Also, you can run the game with the GUI from robocode, just search for *gui* and you'll see the method that enables this option.
